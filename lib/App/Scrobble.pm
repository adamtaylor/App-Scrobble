=head1 DESCRIPTION

Main functionality of L<App::Scrobble>. Takes the command line arguments and
instantiates the correct plugin, if one supports the URL to scrobble.

Instructs the plugin to grab the track data and then submits each track to
L<LastFM|http://www.last.fm>. Makes some vaguely sensible made-up submission times
so all the tracks aren't submitted at exactly the same time.

Works behind a proxy if you set the C<http_proxy> env var.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<scrobble>
